<h><b>Random tidbits from the life of a Harvard grad employed by Google</b></h>

<br>
<br>

<p>Because my alma mater and my employer have been so widely mythologized, I know that there are those who are curious about what it's like to be in my position.  I'll be sharing bits and bits of my experience, with the goal of showing that I'm an imperfect human with plenty of struggles as well as successes, and as a way of partially paying forward my good fortune to the world at large.</p>
